# @flatfile/configure

This package, `@flatfile/configure`, serves as a wrapper for the Flatfile [Blueprint](https://flatfile.com/docs/blueprint/overview) format, providing a convenient tool for schema authoring.

While this package was the foundation in version 3 of the Flatfile product, it continues to be supported in the latest version of the Flatfile platform. However, it is no longer considered a core component for configuring Flatfile, as there are alternative paths available for configuration.

### Key Concepts

Key concepts from this package include:

- [Workbooks](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/workbooks/#workbooks)
- [Sheets](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/workbooks/#sheets)
- [Fields](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/workbooks/#fields)
- [Field Hooks](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/data-hooks/#field-hooks)
- [Record Hooks](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/data-hooks/#record-hooks)

### Get started

We recommend starting with our [Quickstart](https://flatfile.com/docs/quickstart/meet-the-workbook) and configuring your Blueprint either directly or with a [schema plugin](https://flatfile.com/docs/plugins/schemas/).
